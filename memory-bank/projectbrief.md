# Project Brief: CritChat

CritChat is a mobile-first, Snapchat-style social app designed for Tabletop Role-Playing Game (TTRPG) players and their groups.

The core purpose of the app is to provide a dedicated platform for tight-knit campaign parties to:
- Share ephemeral, in-character stories and moments.
- Organize game sessions and scheduling.
- Post persistent recaps of past sessions.
- Discover new games and players through system-tagged content.
- Engage with content in a gamified way to earn Experience Points (XP).
