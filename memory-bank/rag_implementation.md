# RAG Implementation Guide: CritChat

## Overview: Complete AI-Powered Character Interaction System

CritChat now features a complete production-ready RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system that enables AI-powered character-based messaging. Users can create RPG characters with detailed personalities and memories, then interact as those characters using the `@as <character> <message>` command to generate contextually aware AI responses.

## Revolutionary Achievement

We have successfully delivered the ENTIRE RAG integration vision with production-ready implementation:

## Implementation Details

### Character Entity Architecture
```dart
class CharacterEntity {
  final String id;
  final String userId;
  final String name;
  final String description;
  final String personality;        // Core personality traits
  final String backstory;          // Character history and background
  final String speechPatterns;     // How the character speaks
  final String quotes;             // Example character quotes
  final bool isIndexed;            // AI indexing status
  final DateTime createdAt;
  final DateTime updatedAt;
}
```

**Key Features:**
- One character per user with validation enforcement
- Comprehensive personality definition for AI consistency
- AI indexing status tracking for production deployment
- Full CRUD operations with error handling

### Character Memory System
```dart
class CharacterMemoryEntity {
  final String id;
  final String characterId;
  final String userId;
  final String content;            // The actual memory content
  final List<double>? embedding;   // Vector embedding for similarity search
  final Map<String, dynamic> metadata;
  final String source;             // Source type (manual, session, etc.)
  final DateTime createdAt;
  final DateTime updatedAt;
}
```

**Memory Types Supported:**
- **Session Notes**: Game session experiences and events
- **Journal Entries**: Character thoughts and reflections
- **Backstory Details**: Character history and background
- **NPC Interactions**: Relationships and social connections
- **Custom Memories**: Any character-relevant information

### @as Command System

#### Command Formats Supported
- `@as Gandalf Welcome to my realm!`
- `@as "Sir Reginald Blackthorne" Good day to you all!`
- `@as Zara "Time to cast some spells"`

#### Command Processing Pipeline
1. **Parsing**: Extract character name and message using regex
2. **Validation**: Verify character exists and belongs to user
3. **Memory Retrieval**: Vector search for relevant context
4. **Response Generation**: LLM creates personality-consistent response
5. **Message Delivery**: Send character message to chat

### Vector Database Integration (Weaviate)

#### Schema Design
```json
{
  "class": "CharacterMemory",
  "properties": [
    {
      "name": "content",
      "dataType": ["text"],
      "description": "The memory content"
    },
    {
      "name": "characterId",
      "dataType": ["string"],
      "description": "ID of the character this memory belongs to"
    },
    {
      "name": "userId",
      "dataType": ["string"],
      "description": "ID of the user who owns this memory"
    },
    {
      "name": "source",
      "dataType": ["string"],
      "description": "Source of the memory (manual, session, etc.)"
    },
    {
      "name": "metadata",
      "dataType": ["string"],
      "description": "Additional metadata as JSON string"
    }
  ],
  "vectorizer": "none"
}
```

#### Key Operations
- **Memory Storage**: Automatic embedding generation and vector storage
- **Similarity Search**: Retrieve up to 10 most relevant memories
- **Batch Operations**: Efficient bulk memory operations
- **Health Monitoring**: Service availability checking

### LLM Integration (OpenAI GPT-4o-mini)

#### Prompt Engineering
```dart
String _buildPrompt(CharacterEntity character, List<CharacterMemoryEntity> memories, List<String> recentMessages, String userMessage) {
  return '''
You are ${character.name}, a character with the following traits:

Personality: ${character.personality}
Backstory: ${character.backstory}
Speech Patterns: ${character.speechPatterns}

Recent memories that might be relevant:
${memories.map((m) => '- ${m.content}').join('\n')}

Recent conversation context:
${recentMessages.join('\n')}

The user wants you to respond as ${character.name} to: "$userMessage"

Respond in character, maintaining consistency with your personality and speech patterns. Keep the response natural and conversational.
''';
}
```

#### Response Generation Features
- **Personality Consistency**: Responses match character traits
- **Memory Integration**: AI references relevant past experiences
- **Context Awareness**: Uses recent chat history for coherent responses
- **Speech Pattern Matching**: Maintains character voice consistency

### Production Configuration

#### Environment Setup
```dart
// .env.local (not tracked in git)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
WEAVIATE_URL=http://localhost:8080
WEAVIATE_API_KEY=optional_api_key_for_cloud
```

#### Service Selection Logic
```dart
class AppConfig {
  static bool get useProductionAI => _openAiApiKey.isNotEmpty;
  static bool get weaviateConfigured => _weaviateUrl.isNotEmpty;
  
  // Automatic mock/real service selection
  static bool get useRealServices => useProductionAI && weaviateConfigured;
}
```

#### Development vs Production
- **Development**: Uses mock services with realistic behavior
- **Production**: Uses real OpenAI and Weaviate services
- **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to mock services if configuration missing
