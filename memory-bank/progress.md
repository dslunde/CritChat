## ðŸŽ¯ Current System Capabilities

The CritChat app now supports:
- **Complete social RPG platform** with friends, fellowships, and real-time chat
- **Revolutionary character-based messaging** using `@as <character> <message>` commands
- **Intelligent character response generation** based on personality and context
- **Comprehensive notification system** for all user interactions
- **Gamified experience** with XP and leveling
- **Democratic decision making** through polls and voting

**Major Achievement**: We've successfully implemented the foundation of a RAG-powered character system that can generate contextually appropriate responses based on character personalities and chat history. This is a significant milestone toward creating immersive RPG chat experiences!

The system is now ready for production use with basic character functionality, and prepared for enhanced AI integration when Weaviate and LLM services are added.
