- **CI/CD Ready**: Tests pass consistently and are ready for automated testing

### ✅ Code Quality & Technical Debt
- **Linting Issues Resolved**: Fixed all Flutter analyzer warnings and errors
- **Deprecated API Updates**: Replaced deprecated `withOpacity()` with modern `withValues(alpha:)`
- **Proper Logging**: Replaced production `print()` statements with `debugPrint()` for development
- **BLoC Best Practices**: Fixed invalid `emit()` usage in stream listeners

## Next Steps

1. **Group/Campaign Management**: Begin implementing group creation and joining functionality
2. **Firebase Integration**: Replace mock data with actual Firebase Firestore integration

- **UI Patterns**: Consistent design language established across features
- **Code Quality**: Zero-tolerance approach to linting issues maintained
- **Architecture**: Clean architecture with proper separation of concerns working well
