### ✅ Previous Completed Work

### ✅ Authentication System Refactoring (COMPLETE)
- **Race Condition Fix**: Eliminated duplicate `AuthStarted` events that caused UI flashing and redundant state emissions
- **Single Source of Truth**: Made Firebase `authStateChanges` stream the only trigger for authentication state changes
- **Use Case Abstraction**: Created `GetAuthStateChangesUseCase` and `CompleteOnboardingUseCase` to remove direct repository dependencies from BLoC
- **Modular Dependency Injection**: Refactored `injection_container.dart` into feature-specific initialization functions for better maintainability
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Added 18 comprehensive test cases covering all authentication scenarios, state transitions, and race condition prevention
- **Clean Architecture**: Ensured BLoCs depend only on use cases, not directly on repositories
- **Performance Improvement**: Removed unnecessary `Future.delayed()` calls and duplicate event processing

### ✅ Code Quality & Import Standardization (COMPLETE)
- **Import Refactoring Strategy**: Systematically replacing all relative imports with absolute package imports using `package:critchat/...`
- **Completed Files**: 
  - Core dependency injection (`lib/core/di/injection_container.dart`)
  - Complete Fellowship feature (all presentation, domain, and data layer files)
  - Complete Friends feature (all presentation, domain, and data layer files)
  - Complete Notifications feature (all presentation, domain, and data layer files)
  - Complete Auth feature (all presentation, domain, and data layer files)
  - Core shared components (`lib/core/widgets/app_top_bar.dart`)
  - Navigation and utility pages (`lib/features/navigation/main_navigation.dart`, `lib/features/home/home_page.dart`, etc.)
- **Pattern Applied**: Converting imports like `import '../../domain/entities/fellowship_entity.dart'` to `import 'package:critchat/features/fellowships/domain/entities/fellowship_entity.dart'`
- **Benefits**: Improved code maintainability, clearer dependency relationships, better IDE support, consistent project structure

### ✅ Analyzer Issues Resolution (COMPLETE)
- **Curly Braces**: Fixed flow control structures in `fellowship_mock_datasource.dart`
- **Import Optimization**: Changed `import 'package:bloc/bloc.dart'` to `import 'package:flutter_bloc/flutter_bloc.dart'` in `fellowship_bloc.dart`
- **BuildContext Safety**: Added `if (mounted)` checks before using BuildContext in async operations in chat pages
- **Test Cleanup**: Removed unused variables from test files (`fellowship_test.dart`, `friends_notifications_test.dart`)
