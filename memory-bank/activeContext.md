## Current Goal: Authentication System Refinement & Quality Assurance

The authentication system has been fully implemented and is now being refined with enhanced UI, comprehensive testing, and code quality improvements.

## Recent Work Completed

### ✅ UI/UX Enhancements
- **Profile Page Redesign**: Updated HomePage to feature a single-column button layout with specific action buttons:
  1. Find Friends
  2. Join a Campaign  
  3. Looking For Group
  4. Earn XP
  5. Sign Out (functional)
- **Improved Navigation**: Clean, vertical button layout for better mobile experience
- **User Experience**: Added placeholder functionality with "coming soon" messages for future features

### ✅ Testing Suite Implementation
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Replaced basic "Hello Gauntlet" smoke test with robust authentication test suite
- **8 Test Cases**: Full coverage of authentication states, UI components, and error handling
- **Proper Mocking**: Implemented bloc_test and mocktail for clean, isolated testing
- **State Management Testing**: Tests all BLoC states (Loading, Authenticated, Unauthenticated, Error)
- **CI/CD Ready**: Tests pass consistently and are ready for automated testing

### ✅ Code Quality & Technical Debt
- **Linting Issues Resolved**: Fixed all Flutter analyzer warnings and errors
- **Deprecated API Updates**: Replaced deprecated `withOpacity()` with modern `withValues(alpha:)`
- **Proper Logging**: Replaced production `print()` statements with `debugPrint()` for development
- **BLoC Best Practices**: Fixed invalid `emit()` usage in stream listeners
- **Clean Imports**: Removed unused imports and organized code structure

## Current State

The authentication system is production-ready with:
- ✅ Complete user authentication flow
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage (8/8 tests passing)
- ✅ Clean, maintainable codebase with zero analyzer issues
- ✅ Modern UI with improved user experience
- ✅ Proper error handling and logging practices

## Next Steps

1. **Group Management Implementation**: Begin implementing group creation and joining functionality
2. **Firebase Security Rules**: Establish proper Firestore security rules for groups
3. **Group Profile Pages**: Design and implement group-specific UI components
4. **Group State Management**: Extend BLoC pattern for group operations

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- **State Management**: BLoC pattern is working well for authentication; will extend to group management
- **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive widget testing approach established; will expand for group features
- **UI Patterns**: Single-column mobile-first design established; consistent patterns for future features
- **Code Quality**: Zero-tolerance approach to linting issues; maintain high code quality standards
